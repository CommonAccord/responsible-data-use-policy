Introduction.Ti=Introduction

Introduction.Principle.Ti=PRINCIPLES

Introduction.Principle.0.sec={Principles.Three/Four} principles guide the responsible use of data and models by {Organization.Name.Full} (“{Def.Organization.Target}”).  When the policy or related procedures are unclear, these Principles can be used to guide decisions.

Introduction.Principle.1.sec=Principle 1: The {_Organization} should continuously identify and understand risks arising from its data science activities, regardless of whether the harm might be external or internal.

Introduction.Principle.2.sec=Principle 2: The {_Organization} should use data science to contribute positively to the people, processes, and performance of the {_Organization}.

Introduction.Principle.3.sec=Principle 3: Whenever reasonably possible, the {_Organization} should manage risks arising from its data science activities, such as through risk avoidance, reduction, or offset, regardless of whether the harm might be external or internal.

Note=Optional

Introduction.Principle.4.sec=Principle 4: Whenever reasonably possible, the {_Organization} should use data science to contribute positively to people, societies, and environments more broadly.

Introduction.Principle.=[G/Z/ol/s4]

Introduction.Purpose.Ti=PURPOSE

Introduction.Purpose.sec=The {_Organization} desires that its data science activities be conducted in a responsible manner that aligns with the Principles above.  The objective of this {_Policy} is to ensure that the {_Organization} works to achieve these Principles from a technical, legal, and ethical perspective by establishing the standards, restrictions, and procedures that govern data science activities within the {_Organization}.

Introduction.Purpose.=[G/Z/Base]

Introduction.Scope.Ti=SCOPE

Introduction.Scope.0.sec=This {_Policy} applies to:

Introduction.Scope.1.sec=All data science activities, including those commonly described as statistical analysis, business intelligence, analytics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, or any other similar activities (collectively, “{Def.Data_Science.Target}”)

Introduction.Scope.2.sec=All {employees/employees_and_contractors} that manage or perform {_Data_Science} (“{Def.Personnel.Target}”)

Introduction.Scope.3.sec=All data that is used by {_Organization} in the context of {_Data_Science} (“{Def.Covered_Data.Target}”)

Introduction.Procedure.2.2.sec=A Data Science Adjudicator (“{Def.Adjudicator.Target}”) responsible for evaluating such Data Science Proposals

Introduction.Procedure.2.00.1.sec=Submitters complete Data Science Proposal Forms, which are then sent to the responsible {_Adjudicator} for review.  The {_Adjudicator}, which may be an individual or a larger group such as a committee or board, may reject the proposal, request further information or modification, or approve the proposal upon review.

Introduction.Procedure.2.00.2.sec={PolicyOwner.Name.Full} is responsible for the establishment of one or more adjudicators, who must possess relevant experience and qualifications to support the assessment of technical, legal, and ethical considerations. {PolicyOwner.Name.Full} may create a single {_Adjudicator} to review all Proposals or may create multiple {_Adjudicators} to address one-time or recurring use cases such as industry, regulation, or geography.
