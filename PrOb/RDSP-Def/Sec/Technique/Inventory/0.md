Ti=TECHNIQUE INVENTORY

Intro.sec=Note: The techniques below are not mutually exclusive, and some definitions may overlap with each other.  The list below is broadly intended to cover techniques as commonly used or referenced in standards, regulations, or common commercial contracts.

Deletion.Ti=Deletion

Deletion.sec=Deletion is a Pseudo-Anonymization technique that removes a Data Subject or attribute from a Dataset.  Deletion can affect one or more Data Subjects or one or more attributes.  In general, if Deletion is selected for an attribute or Data Subject, Personnel should consider how and why the data was obtained and simply not collect that data from Data Subjects in the future.

Deletion.Example=A classification algorithm is used to screen resumes for hiring.  The Dataset obtained from HR contains an age attribute.  The age attribute is removed from the Dataset.

Deletion.Synonym=Complete Redaction

Masking.Ti=Masking

Masking.sec=Masking is a Pseudo-Anonymization technique that replaces or removes a subset of an attribute, typically while preserving the length or structure of an attribute.  Masking is most commonly applied to data that is naturally character- or text-based.

Masking.Example.Deterministic=Example, Deterministic: The last N digits of a postal code care replaced with a character like # or *.  

Masking.Example.Stochastic=Example, Stochastic: The last N digits of a postal code are replaced with two random letters.

Shuffling.Ti=Shuffling

Shuffling.sec=Shuffling is a Stochastic Pseudo-Anonymization technique that alters the ordering of relationships between Data Subject and attributes.

Shuffling.Example=A Dataset contains the age of individuals.  Each individual is assigned at random the age of a different individual in the Dataset.  

Shuffling.=[G/responsible-data-use-policy/PrOb/RDSP-Def/Sec/Z/Sec.md]

Rounding.Ti=Rounding

Rounding.sec=Rounding is a Pseudo-Anonymization technique that alters a numeric attribute by replacing a value with the nearest point on a discretization of the number line, most typically discretized by tens, ones, or tenths place.  Tie-breaking in rounding may be Deterministic or Stochastic, for example, by 0.5 up or down at random or by always rounding down.  For ordinal values, rounding and binning are typically identical.

Rounding.Example=A Dataset contains the age of individuals.  The ages are rounded to the nearest multiple of five; the ages 22, 23, and 27 are transformed to 20, 25, and 25.

Rounding.=[G/responsible-data-use-policy/PrOb/RDSP-Def/Sec/Z/Sec.md]

Flooring.Ti=Flooring

Flooring.sec=Flooring is a Pseudo-Anonymization technique that alters a numeric attribute by replacing a value with the first  integer value that it is less than or equal to.  Flooring is similar to “rounding down” with integer discretization.

Flooring.Example=A Dataset contains the age of individuals recorded to the first decimal.  The ages 22.0, 22.6, and 22.8 are all replaced by the value 22.  

Flooring.=[G/responsible-data-use-policy/PrOb/RDSP-Def/Sec/Z/Sec.md]

Ceiling.Ti=Ceiling

Ceiling.sec=Ceiling is a Pseudo-Anonymization technique that alters a numeric attribute by replacing a value with the first integer value that it is greater than or equal to. Ceiling is similar to “rounding up” with integer discretization.

Ceiling.Example=A Dataset contains the age of individuals recorded to the first decimal.  The ages 22.0, 22.6, and 22.8 are all replaced by the values 22, 23, and 23.

Ceiling.=[G/responsible-data-use-policy/PrOb/RDSP-Def/Sec/Z/Sec.md]

Truncation.Ti=Truncation

Truncation.sec=Truncation is a Pseudo-Anonymization technique that alters an attribute by removing digits or characters, typically from the end of a written number or string.  For numeric values, truncation is typically equivalent to flooring.


Truncation.Example=A Dataset records the four-digit year of birth of an individual.  The last digit of each year is truncated, resulting in three-digit values.  For example, 1971, 1982, and 1993 are replaced by 197, 198, and 199.

Truncation.SeeAlso=flooring

Truncation.=[G/responsible-data-use-policy/PrOb/RDSP-Def/Sec/Z/Sec.md]

Rank.Ti=Rank

Rank.sec=Ranking is a Pseudo-Anonymization technique that alters an attribute by replacing it with the value’s relative position in an ordering.  In the case of attributes that are cardinal or ordinal, the rank is the mathematical rank of the values.  Non-numeric attributes that have an ordinal interpretation can be mapped to ordinal values and ranked accordingly.

Rank.Example=A survey records open-ended feedback from employees about a company’s culture; a sentiment score is calculated for each response.  Each individual’s sentiment score is then replaced with its rank relative to others.  For example, if three individuals’ feedback scored at 3/10, 6/10, and 5/10, then these values would be replaced with 1, 3, and 2, respectively.  

Rank.SeeAlso=Percentile, Quantile, Parametric Normalization

Rank.=[G/responsible-data-use-policy/PrOb/RDSP-Def/Sec/Z/Sec.md]

Percentile_or_Quantile.sec=Percentile or Quantile

Percentile_or_Quantile.sec=A Percentile is a measure of the percentage of numerical attributes that are less than a given numerical attribute in a Dataset.  A quantile is simply a Percentile stated in decimal units instead of percentage.  Percentiles and Quantiles can be used as a Pseudo-Anonymization technique by altering an attribute to replace it with its corresponding percentile or quantile in a Dataset.

Percentile_or_Quantile.Example=A Dataset contains the age of 50 individuals.  Each individual’s age is replaced with the corresponding percentile for the distribution of ages in the Dataset.  For example, if 35 individuals have an age less than 27, then any individuals with an age of 27 will have their attribute replaced by 35/50 = 70% = 0.7.

Parametric_Normalization.Ti=Parametric Normalization

Parametric_Normalization.sec=Parametric Normalization is a Pseudo-Anonymization technique that alters an attribute by replacing it with a value that is calculated using a sample or population distribution parameter, such as a standard deviation.  Parametric Normalization techniques typically include scaling (division) or shifting (subtraction), such as when normal or Gaussian data is transformed by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. 

Parametric_Normalization.Example=A Dataset contains the heights of individuals.  Using externally-known population parameters or sample statistics, the height of each individual is replaced by dividing the value by the standard deviation.

Hashing.Ti=Hashing

Hashing.sec=Hashing is a Deterministic Pseudo-Anonymization technique that transforms attributes of an arbitrary size to a fixed-length value.  This technique is not intended to be reversible, though it is often intended to be approximately unique.  Hashing is most commonly applied to binary data or data that is naturally character- or text-based.

Hashing.Example.Algorithm=Algorithms: MD5, RIPEMD, SHA1, SHA-2, SHA-3, BLAKE2, BLAKE3

Hashing.Example.SHA2=The SHA2-256 digest of the word “policy” is 823412d1eacb67956220e532959f0104603057c88704863ca38e7cd188fda812.

Encryption.Ti=Encryption

Encryption.sec=Encryption is a Deterministic Pseudo-Anonymization technique that transforms attributes of an arbitrary size into a different representation of arbitrary size that is not reversible by an actor without access to specific information, typically referred to as key(s).  Encryption can be described as “strong” when it is not practically feasible to determine the original attribute value as a result of cost or probability.  Some Encryption techniques may be designed to allow for verification of some information about a message, such as public-key signatures.

Encryption.Example=Algorithms: Substitution Ciphers, Triple DES (3DES), Blowfish, Twofish, AES, RSA, 

Encryption.Synonyms=Cipher

Homomorphic_Encryption.Ti=Homomorphic Encryption

Homomorphic_Encryption.sec=An Encryption technique can be described as Homomorphic in a given context when it supports computation without decryption.  Such encryption can be described as partially- or fully-homomorphic depending on the types of computations that are supported.

Homomorphic_Encryption.Example.Algorithm=Algorithms: BFV, CKKS

Homomorphic_Encryption.Example.Base=Under a homomorphic system supporting addition, two encrypted numbers can be added together by a party without the ability to decrypt them.  When the result of this computation is decrypted by a party with such ability, the answer will be the correct sum.

Collation.Ti=Collation

Collation.sec=Collation is the process of combining information from two or more Datasets to create a new Dataset.  Collation can often improve the ability to achieve Pseudo-Anonymity as seen through k-anonymity or l-diversity measures.  Collation can also reduce the impact of Training Data Bias by increasing the sample size or diversity of certain Attributes or outcomes.

Collation.Example=Five companies pool their hiring data together to create a larger Dataset of candidates and employee history.  Models trained from this collated Dataset are less likely to reproduce any bias in the decisions of a single company’s hiring process, and higher degrees of differential privacy are more likely to be obtained.

Aggregation.Ti=Aggregation

Aggregation.sec=Aggregation is the process of combining information from two or more Data Subjects.   In the case of Aggregation with Data Subjects, Aggregation is typically combined with functions such as a count, sum, average (mean), median, minimum, maximum, range, standard deviation, or other statistical function.

Aggregation.Example.Implementation=Example Implementations: SQL GROUP BY statements, split-apply-combine patterns, map-reduce patterns

Aggregation.Example.Base=A Dataset contains the age and country of residence of individuals.  Individuals are grouped by their country of residence and then the average age within each group is calculated.  Each individual’s age could then be replaced with their respective average for their country of residence.

Frequency_Distribution.Ti=Frequency Distribution

Frequency_Distribution.sec=Frequency Distribution is a Pseudo-Anonymization technique that is typically used to transform character- or binary-based information into a list of unique elements and the number of times each element occurs.  Common elements include single characters, single words (tokens), single bytes, or tuples of consecutive words (n-grams).  In cases where n-grams are used, Personnel should consider whether increasing n can decrease the pseudo-anonymity of the resulting feature data.

Frequency_Distribution.Synonym=histogram, distribution, frequency table

Frequency_Distribution.Example=A Dataset contains the text of an email from one individual to another that reads “We can get lunch tomorrow so we can talk.”  The text is replaced with the frequency distribution count(we)=2, count(can)=2, count(get)=1, count(lunch)=1, count(tomorrow)=1, count(so)=1, count(talk).

Frequency_Distribution.=[G/responsible-data-use-policy/PrOb/RDSP-Def/Sec/Z/Sec.md]

Embeddings_and_Transformers.Ti=Embeddings and Transformers
Embeddings and Transformers are Pseudo-Anonymization techniques that are typically used to transform higher-dimensional data such as images or text into lower-dimensional representations for subsequent clustering or classification.  Many common embedding or transformer models are either fully or partially pre-trained.  Personnel should take care to ensure that any pre-trained models used do not violate this Policy or related Procedures.

Embeddings_and_Transformers.Example=A Dataset contains the text of resume biographies received from applicants.  The text of each biography is replaced by a vector corresponding to the sum of GLoVe vectors for all words in the biography.
