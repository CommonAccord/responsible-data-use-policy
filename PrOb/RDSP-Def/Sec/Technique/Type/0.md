Ti=TYPES OF TECHNIQUES

Perturbative_Techniques.Ti=Perturbative Techniques

Perturbative_Techniques.sec=A Perturbative Technique is a Pseudo-Anonymization process that introduces uncertainty into a Dataset through the alteration of attributes away from their “true” values.  Perturbative Techniques should be used with caution, for example, when the resulting values may be used in the control of a physical system.

Perturbative_Techniques.Example=A Dataset contains the age of individuals.  The age attribute of each individual is altered by adding or subtracting a random number between 0 and 10.  For example, records for three 25-year-old individuals might be altered to have ages 22, 27, and 30.

Non-Perturbative_Techniques.Ti=Non-Perturbative Techniques

Non-Perturbative_Techniques.sec=A Non-Perturbative Technique is a Pseudo-Anonymization process that introduces uncertainty through the reduction, not the alteration, of attribute information.

Non-Perturbative_Techniques.Example=A Dataset contains the age of individuals.  The age attribute of each individual is truncated to the tens place.  For example, all records for 25-year-old individuals would indicate that their age is 20.

Deterministic_Techniques.Ti=Deterministic Techniques

Deterministic_Techniques.sec=A Deterministic Technique is a Pseudo-Anonymization or Modeling process that can be verified to produce the same output for the same inputs.

Example=A Dataset contains the age of an individual.  The individuals are ranked by age, and each individual’s age is replaced by the next youngest age; the youngest individual is removed from the Dataset.

Stochastic_Techniques.Ti=Stochastic Techniques

Stochastic_Techniques.sec=A Stochastic Technique is one that may produce different results for the same input, typically due to the use of random number generation.

Stochastic_Techniques.Synonym=Non-Deterministic, Probabilistic

Stochastic_Techniques.SeeAlso=Perturbative Technique, Non-Perturbative Technique

Stochastic_Techniques.Example=A Dataset contains the age of individuals.  The individuals are ranked by age, and each individual’s age is replaced at random by either the next youngest or next oldest age; the oldest and youngest individuals are removed from the Dataset.
